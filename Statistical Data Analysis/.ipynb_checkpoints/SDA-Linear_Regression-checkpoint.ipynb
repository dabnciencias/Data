    "# Project 2 - House Prices\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "In this project we are given two data sets, each containing information on 1,459 houses in a single city (Ames, Iowa), including 79 variables for each house. The first data set is intended for training our models, while the second is for testing them. Our goal is to predict the price of each home using regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data sets may be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Considerations\n",
    "Before modelling the data, we must:\n",
    "1. Frame the problem and look at the big picture.\n",
    "1. Prepare the data, checking for faulty entries (empty cells or cells with \"nan\"s or other values that do not make sense in the context of the problem) and normalizing it if necessary.\n",
    "1. Explore the data with visual tools to gain some insight and intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "While modelling the data, we must:\n",
    "1. Explore many different models and shortlist the best ones.\n",
    "1. Fine-tune our models, and possibly combine more than one to greater effect."
